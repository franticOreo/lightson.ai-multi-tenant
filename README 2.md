Known Bugs/Issues:
- startSignUp does not provide helpful information to the client if the email sign up fails.
- /signup form claims "field is required" when fields are filled (after going back to previous page).
- takeUserProfileScreenshot will likely return empty instagram page if they identify a bot,
will need to implement a IP proxy method or rotator to avoid this at scale.
